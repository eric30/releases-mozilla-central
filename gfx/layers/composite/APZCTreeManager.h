/**
 * This class manages the tree of AsyncPanZoomController instances. There is one

 * many AsyncPanZoomController instances as there are scrollable container layers.
 * This class generally lives on the compositor thread, although some functions
 * may be called from other threads as noted; thread safety is ensured internally.
 *
 * The bulk of the work of this class happens as part of the UpdatePanZoomControllerTree
 * function, which is when a layer tree update is received by the compositor.
 * This function walks through the layer tree and creates a tree of APZC instances
 * to match the scrollable container layers. APZC instances may be preserved across
 * calls to this function if the corresponding layers are still present in the layer
 * tree.
 *
 * The other functions on this class are used by various pieces of client code to
 * notify the APZC instances of events relevant to them. This includes, for example,
 * user input events that drive panning and zooming, changes to the scroll viewport
 * area, and changes to pan/zoom constraints.
 *
 * Note that the ClearTree function MUST be called when this class is no longer needed;
 * see the method documentation for details.
